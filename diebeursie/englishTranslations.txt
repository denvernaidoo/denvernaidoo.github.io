Pieta can feel his heart pounding against his ribs as the taxi finally jerks away. 
His fingers cling sweatily to the wallet in his pocket.  
He and his buddies walked across the parking lot towards the taxi stand as usual after school, backpacks on their backs. 
That's when he saw something lying on the ground. 
He couldn't understand how the other guys could have missed the wallet.  
It was only when he bent down and quickly made the wallet disappear into his pocket that old Gabba grabbed him. 
"Hey, Pieta! What's that? Let us see too, I say!"  
Old Gabba is the biggest among them. 
He lifted Pieta clean off the ground. 
The others tried to get his hand out of his pocket. 
Their wrestling was playful at first, but the more Pieta resisted, the more he felt a kind of animal instinct in them.  
Out of desperation, he kicked Gabba hard. 
Gabba screamed so loud that the others were startled and left Pieta alone like a hot potato. 
Before they could say anything, Pieta ran away and jumped into the taxi.  
At home, Pieta lies on his bed and closes his eyes. 
He is too afraid to open the wallet. 
He prefers to dream about how much money might be in there.  
What if there are a few hundred bucks? 
Or maybe even a few thousand? What would he buy for himself? 
That new Nokia they're showing on TV? 
Or maybe an iPod?  
"Pieta!" His mom's shrill voice brings him back to reality. 
"Please go borrow milk and sugar from Aunt Marie for us, my child. 
Tell her we'll return it when your dad gets his unemployment money at the end of the week."  
With a heavy heart, Pieta borrows the sugar and milk and decides then and there that he will just give the wallet to his mom.  
Back in his room, he spreads the money out on the bed. 
The coins are shiny and the notes fresh. 
With trembling hands, he starts counting.  
"Pieta!" This time it's his dad. 
"Come help me move that darn cabinet, man!"  
He stuffs the money back into the wallet and puts it in his pocket.  
But darn it, when he bends down to lift one side of the cabinet, the wallet falls out of his pocket! 
Before he can stop it, his dad picks it up.  
"Where did you get this?" 
His dad glares at him. 
"Don't tell me you're a damn pickpocket now! Is this what we raised you for?"
Pieta trembles. 
"No, Dad, I picked it up."  
His dad puts the wallet in his pocket. 
"Come on, son! Now pickup the darn cabinet!"  
When he comes up panting, Pieta immediately wants to ask his dad for the wallet, but the dark expression on his dad's face scares him.  
He sits outside and worries. 
He can't shake the thought that he just saw the sign of the liquor store in his dad's dark eyes.  
A while later, as he walks back to his room, he sees his dad sitting on the couch with his mouth open, asleep. 
His dad's one arm hangs down alongside the couch. 
His jacket is open enough for Pieta to see the wallet almost protruding from his inner pocket.  
A tingle runs through Pieta's body as he slowly pulls the wallet out of his dad's pocket. 
Without thinking twice, he slips out the front door.  
A distance from the house, he opens the wallet. 
He counts the money. 
There is just a little more than a hundred and fifty rand in it.  
In another fold that he hadn't noticed at first glance, he finds a photo. It's of a woman with a baby on her lap. 
The baby doesn't look healthy. Was he perhaps born with a disability? 
Pieta looks again. 
The woman looks a lot like his mom.  
He closes the wallet and looks into the distance.  
And in his imagination, he sees the woman...  
She arrives at the pharmacy to buy medicine for her child. 
The child needs to take the medicine, otherwise he will become very sick later that evening.  
Pieta starts to shake. He scratches further in the wallet. 
There is a driver's license, a bank card, and a torn piece of paper with a phone number on it.  
Pieta takes some coins out of the wallet and goes to a booth to make a call.  
"Hello. Are you Brenda Plaatjies?"  
Even though the voice on the other end is as soft as a whisper, it startles Pieta. 
"No, I'm her sister. Why are you looking for her?"  
"I, I..." Pieta's tongue gets stuck. 
"I picked up her wallet."  
The woman's voice suddenly becomes agitated. 
"Where? Where are you, buddy?"  
Pieta almost wants to hang up the phone and run away, but something stops him. 
"Meet me in an hour at the Cleary Park Mall. By the taxi rank side."  
"Easy now, buddy!" the woman says panicky. 
"You say at the taxi rank? How will I recognize you?"  
He struggles to answer the simple question. 
"I'm wearing a light blue tracksuit and white sneakers."  
A few days later, Pieta and his mom find themselves in the neat living room of the woman whose wallet he picked up. 
The dignified woman has a white envelope in her hand. 
Next to her sits a journalist with a camera around his neck and a notebook in his hand.  
When the woman thanks Pieta and hands over the envelope, the camera flashes. 
It's a pity Dad isn't here too, Pieta thinks.  
It's only two days later, when he sees the photo and the article in the newspaper, that his dad smiles. 
"Pieta!" he calls excitedly.  
He puts his arm around his son's shoulders and says for the first time the words that would be music in Pieta's ears for years to come:  
"I am so proud of you!"
